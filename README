--This is the README file for the float moodle project/website of Rakesh Kumar(200050120) Guduru Manoj(200050044) Anish Makam(200050069) Deeti Yeshash Chandra(200050031)--
We have made the website using the Django framework 
The virtual environment to run the website locally on your machine is present in the outlab-env folder
To activate the virtual environment on your machine run: (this environment is for only for the unix distro)
source outlab-env/bin/active
Run the above command in the directory where the environment folder is present
After the environment is set up, run:
cd moodle/
to go the next directory
Next run:
python3 manage.py runserver
Since the website is not deployed, the url http://127.0.0.1:8000/ open the website
However the virtual environment required for other os are different
So are the commands
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there is no database file in the moodle folder then, run the following commands:
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver
This will create the new database (we have opted to use the sqlite3 default database in the settings.py)
